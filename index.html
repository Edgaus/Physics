    Physics for Fools
  </h1>
   Physics is the bedrock of science, the field of science that makes the fundamental
  pilars of which the other fields lay upon.
  Physics as any other science functions according to the scientific method.
  Humans encounter a phenomena or object of the world which cannot be explained or  understood.
  according to our long history we will try to explain either its existence or its functionakity and
  finally the implications of this knowledge.
  if all we were living in the old classic Greece we would obtain the information from reason and logic, 
  nowdays we use experiments to prove our assumptions.
  In order to explain, fisrt we make proposition of how the world works, an axiom, then we would prove the implications
  of this new threory, how? By experiments, tests that are replicable around the world y solid with enough resilution 
  So in physics we have many theories of how the world works, some are proven to been wrong and others are not yet proven 
  to be proven wrong yet. So in reality what we have are interpretations of the world wauting to be destroyed and yet has been 
  enough to gets us here.
  In terms of size we have 3 main theores, for small things we have quantum mechanics, for for regukar

      Semmiconductores
    </section>

    <p>
      This site is a personal project that I've build to represent the investigation that I've working the last two years in order to finish my master thesis
      in semmiconductores. Nothing more to add. Let's begin.
    </p>

    <p>
      First I have to answer:
      What is a semmiconductor? <br>
      A semiconductor is a material that can behave like a conductor or as an isultaror in function of external agents, like pressuare, radiation, temperature, electric and/or 
      magnetic field.
    </p>

      Why semiconductors?

    <p>
      Im gonna still a post from Quora,thanks Abhishek Rajeev  <br>

      Awww..so cute aren't they!! I hope you feel the same. Who doesn't?!!<br>

      But now let me ask you a question?<br>
      
      Which of the above(tiger or a dog) would you prefer to keep as a pet? May be to watch you house?<br>
      
      Many might love to have a cub. Even i admit i do. But what about a big tiger? No one would. For Obvious reason!! Because it's UNCONTROLLABLE and FIERCE. Isn't it?!!!
      <br> 
      It is the same for conductors and semiconductor.
      <br>
      TIGER = CONDUCTOR (you just cannot control it's conductivity)
      <br>
      DOG = SEMICONDUCTOR (conductivity is controllable by doping)
      <br>
      It's an relation which i came up while writing this answer.
      <br>
      Hope you find it relatable!.
      <br>
      Happy learning :)
    </p>

    The fact that we can control the flow of the current allows to storage for example in a capacitor and from that

  <h1>  Glossary </h1>

  <h2> Substrate </h2>

  In semiconductors, a substrate refers to the underlying material on which semiconductor devices are built. It provides a stable and often insulating foundation 
  for the active semiconductor components to be deposited or grown upon. The choice of substrate material is crucial, as it can significantly influence the performance 
  and characteristics of the semiconductor device.<br>

  <h3> Why use substrates in semiconductors? </h3>
  A substrate provides a single crystal foundation for the semiconductor material. Semiconductors typically exhibit the best electronic properties when they have a 
  single, continuous crystal lattice structure. The substrate acts as a template upon which the semiconductor material can grow or be deposited in an ordered and 
  aligned manner, ensuring a high-quality crystal structure.


  <h2> Bulk </h2>
  In the context of semiconductors, "bulk" refers to the main or central region of a semiconductor material. It is the portion of the material where the majority 
  of electronic activity and charge carriers (electrons and holes) are located
</section>



<h2> Crystal Growth </h2>

   Crytal growth in the field of semiconudcors refers to the process of growing singly crystals of semiconductos materiales with high purity and uniformity.

   <h3>Why Crystals?</h3>
   From a theorical point of view, when we are tying to describe materials wich are sets of atoms, the simplest construction or model is a crystal, an arrange that 
   it repeats itself along all spac. So we can semiconductors with a very good carachterization with known parameters through crystals models, but can be improven through the 
   use of doping, impurity made in purpouse in order to boost some properties.
