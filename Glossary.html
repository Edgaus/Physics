          <h2> Substrate </h2>

          In semiconductors, a substrate refers to the underlying material on which semiconductor devices are built. It provides a stable and often insulating foundation 
          for the active semiconductor components to be deposited or grown upon. The choice of substrate material is crucial, as it can significantly influence the performance 
          and characteristics of the semiconductor device.<br>

          <h3> Why use substrates in semiconductors? </h3>
          
          A substrate provides a single crystal foundation for the semiconductor material. Semiconductors typically exhibit the best electronic properties when they have a 
          single, continuous crystal lattice structure. The substrate acts as a template upon which the semiconductor material can grow or be deposited in an ordered and 
          aligned manner, ensuring a high-quality crystal structure.

          <h2> Bulk </h2>

          In the context of semiconductors, "bulk" refers to the main or central region of a semiconductor material. It is the portion of the material where the majority 
          of electronic activity and charge carriers (electrons and holes) are located
