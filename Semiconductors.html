      <h1>  Electronic and Optoelectronic Properties of Semmiconductor Structures  </h1>
      <p>
        This site is a personal project that I've build to represent the investigation that I've working the last two years in order to finish my master thesis
        in semmiconductores. Nothing more to add. Let's begin.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        First I have to answer:
        What is a semmiconductor? <br>
        A semiconductor is a material that can behave like a conductor or as an isultaror in function of external agents, like pressuare, radiation, temperature, electric and/or 
        magnetic field.

        Im gonna still a post from Quora,thanks Abhishek Rajeev  <br>

            Awww..so cute aren't they!! I hope you feel the same. Who doesn't?!!
            
            But now let me ask you a question?

            Which of the above(tiger or a dog) would you prefer to keep as a pet? May be to watch you house

            Many might love to have a cub. Even i admit i do. But what about a big tiger? No one would. For Obvious reason!! Because it's 
            
            UNCONTROLLABLE and FIERCE. Isn't it?!!!

            It is the same for conductors and semiconductor.

            TIGER = CONDUCTOR (you just cannot control it's conductivity)

            DOG = SEMICONDUCTOR (conductivity is controllable by doping)

            It's an relation which i came up while writing this answer.

            Hope you find it relatable!.

            Happy learning :)

      The fact that we can control the flow of the current allows to storage for example in a capacitor and from that

<h2> Crystal Growth </h2>

Crytal growth in the field of semiconudcors refers to the process of growing singly crystals of semiconductos materiales with high purity and uniformity.

<h3>Why Crystals?</h3>
From a theorical point of view, when we are tying to describe materials wich are sets of atoms, the simplest construction or model is a crystal, an arrange that 
it repeats itself along all spac. So we can semiconductors with a very good carachterization with known parameters through crystals models, but can be improven through the 
use of doping, impurity made in purpouse in order to boost some properties.


<h3> How to growth crystals? </h3>

First we need to growth bulk crystals which are sliced and polished to allow epitaxial growth of thin semiconductors regions including heterostrucutres.
