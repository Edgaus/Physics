      Physics for Fools
    </h1>
  
    Physics is the bedrock of science, the field of science that makes the fundamental
    pilars of which the other fields lay upon.
    Physics as any other science functions according to the scientific method.
    Humans encounter a phenomena or object of the world which cannot be explained or  understood.
    according to our long history we will try to explain either its existence or its functionakity and
    finally the implications of this knowledge.
    if all we were living in the old classic Greece we would obtain the information from reason and logic, 
    nowdays we use experiments to prove our assumptions.
    In order to explain, fisrt we make proposition of how the world works, an axiom, then we would prove the implications
    of this new threory, how? By experiments, tests that are replicable around the world y solid with enough resilution 
    So in physics we have many theories of how the world works, some are proven to been wrong and others are not yet proven 
    to be proven wrong yet. So in reality what we have are interpretations of the world wauting to be destroyed and yet has been 
    enough to gets us here.
    In terms of size we have 3 main theores, for small things we have quantum mechanics, for for regukar
